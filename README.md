enzymeModel
============

[Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny) web app that uses an ODE solver ([deSolve](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html)) to run a simple Michaelis-Menton enzyme kinetics model.

The simulation and key view elements are factored out in `model.R`, making it relatively easy to alter the core features of the application.

A quick tutorial for rna.wlu.edu users that walks through how you can fork and hack this simulation can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/whitwort/bindingModel/wiki/Tutorial-for-rna.wlu.edu-users).
